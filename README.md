# Camera Calibration - Zhang's Method 📷✨🔍🛠️📐

This project provides example code for performing camera calibration using Python. 

It estimates the intrinsic parameters of a pinhole camera model, such as focal length and principal point, enabling accurate interpretation of images captured by the camera.

## Purpose of this project ✨
- Understanding and applying the camera model & Camera Geometry
  
- Learning the camera calibration process 

- Image correction through estimation of intrinsic parameters

- Reviewing papers and writing code to learn both theoretically and practically applicable methods

## Why Zhang's Method 🔍
One of the well-known calibration methods in the field of computer vision, which allows for simple calibration using only a checkerboard pattern

## Project features 📝

1. Implementation will be done using .ipynb files, with the purpose of studying rather than actual usage

2. Each cell is accompanied by comments to provide explanations for the code
